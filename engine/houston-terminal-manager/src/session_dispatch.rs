//! Single dispatch site mapping a provider to its session-runner module.
//!
//! Runners (claude_runner.rs, codex_command.rs / spawn_codex) parse very
//! different stream formats and have non-trivial spawn-side state. Rather
//! than push their entire surface (build_command + parse_line + retry
//! policy + stderr classification) onto the [`ProviderAdapter`] trait, we
//! keep them as standalone modules and let this file own the one match
//! that picks among them.
//!
//! REASON for the standalone-modules + central-dispatch shape (option (c)
//! in the design notes): each runner's parser is hundreds of lines of
//! provider-specific event handling and fits naturally as a module of
//! its own. Putting that behind a `dyn` trait would either bloat the
//! adapter trait or force every adapter to re-export a sub-trait — both
//! cost more than this single dispatch site, which is exactly two arms
//! today and grows by one line per provider. Reconsider promoting the
//! runner to its own trait once a third or fourth provider exposes a
//! genuinely different lifecycle (e.g. a streaming HTTP transport
//! instead of a CLI subprocess).
