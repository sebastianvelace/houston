# Platform Matrix — Rust (engine/) layer

Status of Windows support at the engine's Rust surface as of this
commit. CI wiring (matrix build, artifact naming, updater targets)
is owned by Wave 2 / E₂ and not tracked here.

## Build verification

| Target | Status | How verified |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | ✅ native | `cargo test --workspace --exclude houston-app --exclude houston-tauri` |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | ✅ (inherits Darwin code paths) | — |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | ✅ (inherits Unix code paths) | — |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` | ✅ `cargo check` clean | `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -p houston-engine-server` with `mingw-w64` toolchain |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | ⚠️ untested on macOS host — `ring`'s build script needs MSVC CRT headers (fetch via `xwin` or build on Windows) | — |

The two Windows targets share the same Rust source. MSVC vs GNU differs
only in CRT/linker — every `cfg(windows)` branch in Houston applies to
both.

## Cross-platform primitives — in use

- **Home dir**: `dirs::home_dir()` (HOME on Unix; on Windows `dirs 5`
  resolves via the known-folder API and ignores `USERPROFILE`).
  `std::env::var("HOME")` is banned in engine code.
  `houston-composio::install::home_dir` checks `USERPROFILE` first on
  Windows so callers and tests can redirect `~/.composio` resolution
  (it equals the known-folder profile in normal use, so production
  behavior is unchanged).
- **PATH manipulation**: `std::env::split_paths` / `std::env::join_paths`
  — never hand-roll the separator.
- **Symlinks**: `std::os::unix::fs::symlink` on Unix,
  `std::os::windows::fs::symlink_file` / `symlink_dir` on Windows.
  Both branches wired in `agents_crud.rs`, `agents/prompt.rs`,
  `skills.rs`. Windows symlink creation needs Developer Mode or
  admin; stock installs fail with os error 1314 ("A required
  privilege is not held by the client"). Call sites that expose
  content to a sibling CLI fall back to `fs::copy` so non-admin
  Windows users still get it: AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md in
  `agents/prompt.rs` and `houston-agent-files::migrate_agent_data`,
  and the `.claude/skills/<name>` discovery mirror in `skills.rs`
  (copies the whole skill dir when `symlink_dir` is denied, and
  re-copies on `save` so edits don't go stale). The gemini runtime-home staging
  (`houston-terminal-manager::gemini_home::ensure_symlink`) also
  tolerates a missing source on the copy fallback so first-time
  gemini users without `~/.gemini/.env` or OAuth files do not hit
  "Failed to prepare gemini runtime home".
- **PATH lookup**: `houston-terminal-manager::provider::which_on_path`
  walks each PATH directory. On Windows it checks `.exe` / `.cmd` /
  `.bat` variants BEFORE the bare filename in each directory so
  npm-global CLIs (which ship both `<name>` — Unix script — and
  `<name>.cmd` — Windows shim — in the same dir) resolve to the
  executable shim instead of the unexecutable script. Without that,
  `Command::new(...)` later fails with os error 193 ("%1 is not a valid
  Win32 application"). Two guards keep the resolver from ever returning a
  guaranteed-193 path (regression from issue #213): `.ps1` is NOT probed
  (`CreateProcess` can't launch a PowerShell script directly, and Rust's
  `Command` only wraps `.bat`/`.cmd` through cmd.exe), and the bare,
  extensionless fallback is accepted only when the file is a real PE
  image (`MZ` magic) — a bare file is almost always a Unix shim script.
  Inner pure helper `which_in_dirs(command, iter)` is exposed for tests
  so the per-platform priority can be verified without mutating
  process-global PATH.
- **PTY**: `portable-pty` (used in `houston-terminal-manager::manager`)
  — ConPTY-backed on Windows 10+, no code change needed.
- **File watcher**: `notify` — native backends on each OS.

## Platform-specific branches

| Area | File | Unix | Windows |
|------|------|------|---------|
| Session cancel | `engine-core/src/sessions/mod.rs::cancel` | `kill -TERM <pid>` | `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` |
| Worktree shell (`run_shell`) | `engine-core/src/worktree.rs::run_shell` | `sh -c <command>` | `cmd /C <command>` (no `sh` on Windows) |
| `engine.json` perms | `engine-server/src/main.rs::write_manifest` | `chmod 0o600` | inherits NTFS ACL from parent (sufficient; user dir is per-user) |
| Composio installer | `houston-composio/src/install.rs::install` | `bash -c "curl \| bash"` | returns a clear error — auto-install not wired (see **gaps** below) |
| Composio executable check | `houston-composio/src/install.rs::is_installed` | file + `+x` bit | file existence only (NTFS has no POSIX +x; Composio installer drops `composio.exe`) |
| Composio CLI path | same | `~/.composio/composio` | `~/.composio/composio.exe` |
| Login-shell PATH probe | `houston-terminal-manager/src/claude_path.rs` | `/bin/zsh -l -c 'echo $PATH'`, fallback `/bin/bash -l`, `-i` | skipped — inherited process PATH is already the user PATH |
| Common-install-dir probe | same | `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.composio`, nvm node dirs | `~\.cargo\bin`, `~\.composio`, `~\AppData\Roaming\npm`, `~\AppData\Local\Programs\claude` |
| Command-exists check | same `is_command_available` | bare filename | bare + `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat`/`.ps1` variants |
| Gemini CLI spawn | `houston-terminal-manager/src/gemini_runner.rs` + `houston-engine-core/src/sessions/provider_oneshot.rs::run_gemini` | bundled SEA per arch (`Resources/bin/gemini-<arch>/gemini`) | bundled binary not shipped in v1; falls back to user-installed gemini-cli on PATH (e.g. `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli`). Two Windows-specific quirks make this work: (a) `which_on_path` prefers `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` variants over the bare filename so the npm-global `.cmd` shim wins over the unexecutable Unix script that ships in the same dir (avoids os error 193, "%1 is not a valid Win32 application"; `.ps1` is not probed and a bare extensionless match must be a real PE — see the PATH-lookup note above); (b) `gemini_compatible_path` strips the `\\?\` extended-length prefix from canonicalized agent paths before they hit `--include-directories` because gemini-cli's Node-based `fs.realpathSync` parses each component and crashes with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, lstat 'C:'`. If neither bundled nor PATH-installed, both call sites short-circuit with a platform-aware "not available yet" toast. UI also unlocks the chat-model dropdown when the locked provider has `cli_installed=false` (`chat-model-selector.tsx`). |

## Known gaps — Windows needs a follow-up

1. **Composio CLI install**: Windows path surfaces an error pointing the
   user at <https://composio.dev/install>. Composio publishes a
   PowerShell installer; wiring it in needs a real Windows box to test
   SHA checksum, install directory, and PATH-append semantics.
2. **Claude / Codex CLI discovery**: `COMMON_CLAUDE_DIRS` on Windows is
   a best guess (npm global dir, cargo bin, a plausible
   `AppData\Local\Programs\claude`). Needs validation against actual
   Claude Code / Codex Windows distributions once they publish.
3. **nvm on Windows** (`nvm-windows` by coreybutler) lives at
   `%APPDATA%\nvm\v<ver>\` with a different shape than nvm.sh — not
   yet probed; Node tools installed via nvm-windows won't be picked up
   unless they're on PATH already.
4. **Process-group kill**: on Unix we `kill -TERM` the single PID we
   tracked; Windows uses `taskkill /T` which walks the child tree.
   Semantics differ — Windows is forceful (`/F`) because Console
   applications don't respond to clean-shutdown signals unless they're
   in our console group. If this becomes a problem (e.g. sessions that
   need graceful Claude shutdown to flush token caches), switch to
   `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` via a detached child console.
5. **MSVC target build**: not verified on the macOS host. CI on Windows
   runners (E₂'s scope) is the authoritative check. Cross-compile from
   macOS would need `xwin` (MSVC SDK headers) — not installed locally.

## Deliberately untouched in this pass

- `app/` and `ui/` Windows support — owned by Wave 2 / E₂.
- `.github/workflows/*` matrix — owned by Wave 2 / E₂.
- `houston-composio::cli`, `::auth`, `::mcp` — these call `whoami`,
  `open`, `security` (macOS `security(1)`), which will not work on
  Windows either. They compile (process spawns fail at runtime with a
  clear I/O error), but the features that depend on them are not
  expected to work on Windows without additional work. Left out of
  scope to keep this diff tight.

## Wave 2 status (composio Windows + MSI build pipeline)

Wave 2 landed alongside the gethouston/composio fork and the new
`build-windows` GitHub Actions job. Status of the previously-listed
gaps:

1. **Composio CLI install** — RESOLVED. Production Windows builds
   bundle composio.exe via the gethouston/composio fork (built from
   source on the windows-latest runner). The dev-mode error message
   stays as-is because there's no benefit to running composio
   standalone outside a packaged Houston install. See
   `knowledge-base/cli-bundling.md` for the build pipeline.
2. **Claude / Codex CLI discovery** — VALIDATED for x64. Codex ships
   native `codex-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` from openai/codex; we
   download + zstd-decode + bundle. Claude Code's distribution
   manifest exposes `win32-x64` + `win32-arm64` URLs which the
   runtime installer resolves automatically. The `COMMON_CLAUDE_DIRS`
   list still covers the npm + AppData scenarios.
3. **nvm-windows** — STILL UNVALIDATED. Houston's bundled CLIs win
   over PATH lookups in production, so this only matters for dev
   builds running unbundled.
4. **Process-group kill** — UNCHANGED.
5. **MSVC target build** — VERIFIED via the new `build-windows` CI
   job (`cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -p
   houston-engine-server`). Mac-host cross-compile remains
   unsupported (no `xwin` SDK) and is not on the roadmap.

One new gap introduced in Wave 2:

6. **Windows MSI signing** — Wave 2 ships UNSIGNED. SignPath
   Foundation integration is blocked on operational provisioning
   (project + secret rotation in CI). See cli-bundling.md "Windows
   signing — deferred" for the wire-up plan. The Tauri-updater
   minisign signature (covering in-app auto-update verification) IS
   produced and uploaded — that's separate from OS code-signing.

Auto-updater Windows entries are now wired: `build-windows`
downloads the macOS-only `latest.json` uploaded by `build-macos`,
adds a `windows-x86_64` entry pointing at the MSI + its minisign
.sig, and re-uploads with `--clobber`. The Tauri updater plugin
already runs on Windows; users on previous builds will see the
update prompt automatically the next time they launch.
