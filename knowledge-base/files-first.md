# Files-First (`.houston/`)

Houston uses files, not DB, for agent-visible data. SQLite only for chat replay + app prefs.

## Rule
If @houston-ai component renders it → `.houston/` folder.
If app-specific → `.houston/`.

## Layout

```

```

## File I/O path
Frontend never touches the filesystem directly. All `.houston/` reads
and writes flow through `@houston-ai/engine-client` → `houston-engine`
REST routes (`/v1/agents/:path/files/:kind`, etc.), which call into
`houston-agent-files`. Writes are atomic (temp + rename) and emit a
matching `HoustonEvent` over the WS. No typed CRUD — per-type folder +
schema + a generic read/write pair covers everything.

## Schemas
Authoritative. Live in `ui/agent-schemas/src/*.schema.json`. Embedded in Rust via `include_str!` in `houston-agent-files::schemas`. Seeded into each agent's `.houston/<type>/<type>.schema.json` on first launch. Prompts instruct model to read schema before writing data file.

## Learnings prompt injection
`engine/houston-engine-core/src/agents/prompt.rs::build_agent_context`
injects `.houston/learnings/learnings.json` into each session as a
bounded, frozen-at-session-start background block. Only each entry's
`text` field is rendered; `id`, `created_at`, and any future metadata
stay storage/UI-only. Writes during a session persist immediately but are
not visible in the already-started prompt until the next session.

## Migration
`houston_agent_files::migrate_agent_data()` runs on every `seed_agent()`. Idempotent. Leaves legacy flat-layout data files in place as rollback. Legacy product-prompt seeds (`.houston/prompts/system.md`, `.houston/prompts/self-improvement.md`) are deleted — the Houston product prompt now lives in the app binary (`app/src-tauri/src/houston_prompt/`), not on disk.

Session resume IDs are provider-scoped for new writes so Claude and Codex
never overwrite each other's current resume ID. Existing
`.houston/sessions/{session_key}.sid` files stay in place and are read as
a fallback until a provider writes its own scoped `.sid`. Chat history
loads the legacy ID plus every provider current/history ID for the same
session key. Provider-scoped `.invalid` files stop a rejected legacy ID
from being retried by the provider that rejected it.

## Atomic writes
All writes: temp file + rename. Path-traversal safe via `houston-agent-files::safe_relative`.

## Activity statuses
`running` · `needs_you` · `done` · `error`

Source of truth: `ui/agent-schemas/src/activity.schema.json`. The board renders `error` inside the **needs you** column with a red border so failed sessions don't vanish. Any code path that may have flipped a row to `running` (optimistic UI write, engine `set_status_by_session_key("running")`) MUST guarantee a terminal status on exit — including cancel-of-queued and early start-failure, both handled in `engine/houston-engine-core/src/sessions/mod.rs`. Skipping the terminal flip leaves missions visibly stuck on "running" forever.

## Skills discovery
Skills live at `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Houston mirrors to `.claude/skills/<name>` via symlink (Claude Code reads). Flat `.md` under `.agents/skills/` auto-migrated to `<name>/SKILL.md` on next `list_skills`.

Same files surface in the UI as **Skills**. Frontmatter drives card image, category tabs, featured-state showcase, and integration logos. Selecting a Skill pins it above the regular composer; free-form text remains in chat. Full schema + render pipeline → [`skills.md`](skills.md).

## SQLite (minimal)
Only two tables:
- `chat_feed` - keyed by provider CLI session id (`claude_session_id` column name is legacy). UI conversation replay on restart.
- `preferences` — app-level (last_workspace_id etc). Not scoped.

Everything else lives in files.

User-message rows may include leading `<!--houston:skill ...-->` or
`<!--houston:attachments ...-->` markers (the legacy `<!--houston:action ...-->`
prefix is still decoded for chat history written before the rename). These are display metadata only;
the same row still contains the Claude-facing prompt body after the marker.
Renderers decode the marker so non-technical users see cards/badges instead
of file paths or internal prompt instructions.

## Session file-change attribution
Chat sessions snapshot user-visible project files before and after the
CLI run. The engine diffs those snapshots and persists a `file_changes`
feed item with `created` and `modified` absolute paths. The visible-file
filter is shared with the project file browser, so helper files such as
Python scripts, JSON, Markdown, `.houston/`, `.agents/`, and dotdirs stay
out of non-technical chat summaries.

Attribution is strict only when one session owns a working directory. The
engine enforces that by holding a per-`working_dir` guard for chat and
routine sessions. Different worktrees/folders can run in parallel. A
second session in the same folder gets a conflict instead of producing a
false file summary.

## AI-native reactivity (MANDATORY)

Users + LLMs equal participants. Both read/write all workspace data. All changes visible to both immediately.

### Two writers
1. **Frontend via the engine** — user clicks "Create Activity" → React hook → `engine-client` → `houston-engine` REST route → `houston-agent-files` writes the file.
2. **CLI agent direct writes** — the claude/codex subprocess writes `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or updates `.houston/<type>/<type>.json` directly without talking to the engine.

### Three-layer reactivity stack
1. **TanStack Query (frontend)** — all `.houston/` fetches via `useQuery`. Query keys: `["activity", agentPath]` etc. Dedup, background refresh, stale-while-revalidate.
2. **Event emission on engine writes** — the engine's write helpers emit `HoustonEvent` variants (`SkillsChanged`, `ActivityChanged`, `LearningsChanged`, …) onto its broadcast bus. The desktop WS client (`ui/engine-client`) fans them out; global listeners in `app/src/hooks/use-agent-invalidation.ts` invalidate the matching query key.
3. **File watcher on `.houston/` (Rust `notify`, `houston-file-watcher`)** — catches direct agent writes that bypass the engine's write path. Emits the same events onto the same bus. Debounced.

### The rule
Never build feature where agent changes data but UI won't reflect until refresh. If in `.houston/`, must be reactive.

## User data = upgrade-safe
Files under `~/.houston/**` (including legacy `~/Documents/Houston/**` from earlier versions) exist on user machines. Changing shape/layout requires **idempotent migration** on upgrade. See `houston_agent_files::migrate_agent_data`. Never leave existing users broken.
