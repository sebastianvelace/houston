# Auth (Supabase + Google SSO)

One-click Google sign-in on first launch. CI release tokens live in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager, never localStorage or disk. Local builds use browser storage scoped per worktree to avoid macOS Keychain prompts from changing local signatures. Identifies users in PostHog, lays the foundation for Houston Cloud.

## The flow (PKCE)

1. User clicks **Continue with Google** in `SignInScreen`.
2. Frontend calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google", options: { redirectTo: "houston://auth-callback", skipBrowserRedirect: true } })`.
3. Supabase generates a PKCE code_verifier, writes it to the configured auth storage adapter, returns an auth URL.
4. Frontend opens the URL in the user's system browser via `tauriSystem.openUrl()`.
5. User completes Google consent.
6. Google redirects to Supabase → Supabase redirects to `houston://auth-callback?code=<code>`.
7. macOS delivers the URL to the running Houston via `tauri-plugin-deep-link`.
8. Rust handler in `app/src-tauri/src/auth.rs::emit_deep_link` forwards the URL on a Tauri event (`auth://deep-link`).
9. Frontend listener in `app/src/lib/auth.ts::installDeepLinkListener` extracts `code`, calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)` — Supabase reads the verifier from configured auth storage, exchanges, writes the session back.
10. `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` fires → `useSession()` re-queries → `App.tsx` dismisses `SignInScreen` → sidebar footer `UserMenu` + Settings → Account section appear.
11. PostHog: `analytics.alias(userId, { email, name })` merges the anonymous `install_id` history into the identified user.

## Keychain boundary

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Session JSON (access_token, refresh_token, user) | CI releases: Keychain entry `com.houston.app.auth` / `houston-auth` |
| PKCE code verifier | CI releases: Keychain entry `com.houston.app.auth` / `sb-…-auth-token-code-verifier` (Supabase-managed key) |
| Storage adapter | CI releases: `app/src/lib/supabase.ts::keychainStorage` → Tauri commands `auth_get_item` / `auth_set_item` / `auth_remove_item` in `auth.rs` |
| Local storage | Browser storage with worktree-scoped key `houston-auth-local-<hash>` |
| Rust dep | `keyring = "3"` with `apple-native` + `windows-native` features |

CI releases never touch localStorage. If Keychain is locked or unavailable, the in-memory session on the current run still works; nothing persists across launches. Degraded mode, not failure.

Local builds are different on purpose: Supabase uses browser storage with a worktree-scoped key (`houston-auth-local-<hash>`) and the Rust startup path does not read the persisted Keychain user id. macOS can treat every rebuild or worktree as a different app for Keychain access and show repeated password prompts. CI builds keep Keychain storage. Override with `HOUSTON_AUTH_STORAGE=keychain` or `HOUSTON_AUTH_STORAGE=browser`.

## Gating + offline behavior

- `isAuthConfigured()` (true when `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` baked in) is the master switch. Unconfigured builds skip auth entirely — useful for local dev without secrets.
- `App.tsx` shows a splash while `useSession()` is loading, `SignInScreen` once the session resolves to `null`, the app otherwise.
- `supabase.auth.getSession()` reads local auth storage (CI-release Keychain, local browser storage) — transient Supabase blips do NOT kick the user. Silent token refresh handles token TTL under the hood.
- Hard sign-out: `signOut()` in `app/src/lib/auth.ts` clears the configured Supabase session storage and calls `analytics.reset()` so subsequent anonymous events don't attach to the prior user.

## PostHog integration

- Anonymous launch: `distinct_id = install_id` (minted in `install-id.ts`).
- Sign-in: `analytics.alias(userId, { email, name })` — merges the pre-signup history to the identified user.
- Sign-out: `analytics.reset()` — future events use a fresh anonymous `distinct_id`.

## Engine identity plumbing

- At engine spawn (`app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), CI-release builds read the persisted Supabase session from Keychain and pass `HOUSTON_APP_USER_ID` as an env var to the subprocess. Local builds skip this Keychain read. Engine treats the value as an opaque string.
- The env var is only set when the user was already signed in on a prior launch and the build uses Keychain auth storage. First-run signed-in users don't get the env var until the next app restart — engine doesn't need it yet; server-side use is future work.
- `HoustonEvent` envelope does NOT carry `user_id` today — deferred until there's a server-side consumer that needs it. When that lands, wrap `HoustonEvent` in an envelope struct in `engine/houston-ui-events` rather than adding `user_id` to each variant.

## Required secrets

| Var | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project settings → Project URL | Public; baked into the bundle at build time via Vite `define` |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase project settings → Project API keys → `anon` `public` | Public by design; RLS policies gate all data access |

Also in CI as GitHub Secrets.

## One-time GCP setup (human)

1. GCP Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
2. Type: Web application
3. Authorized redirect URI: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` (from Supabase → Auth → Google → Callback URL)
4. Copy client_id + client_secret → Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google → paste + enable

## One-time Supabase setup (via Supabase MCP)

Minimal schema + trigger to auto-create a `profiles` row on user signup:

```sql
create table public.profiles (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users on delete cascade,
  email text not null,
  name text,
  avatar_url text,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  last_seen_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
alter table public.profiles enable row level security;
create policy "read own profile" on public.profiles for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "update own profile" on public.profiles for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create function public.handle_new_user() returns trigger as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles (user_id, email, name, avatar_url)
  values (new.id, new.email, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url');
  return new;
end; $$ language plpgsql security definer;

create trigger on_auth_user_created after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

## What's deliberately out of scope

- Apple SSO, email magic-link, phone OTP. Surface a "More sign-in options coming soon" microcopy line today; add providers later in Supabase dashboard.
- Server-side Rust emitting PostHog events directly — frontend covers Houston's event surface.
- Houston Cloud API endpoints — this is the identity foundation, not the product surface.
- Mobile (Capacitor) — Supabase JS works there too; deep-link scheme registered separately per platform.
- In-app NPS — PostHog has it built in; configure later.
- Teams / orgs, Stripe billing — future Supabase schema extensions.

## Provider CLI re-auth (Claude Code / Codex)

Separate from Houston account auth. Claude Code and Codex keep their own CLI
sessions. When those sessions expire mid-chat, `houston-terminal-manager`
classifies auth-shaped stderr/stdout (`401`, `unauthorized`, `not authenticated`,
expired OAuth/API-key messages) and `houston-agents-conversations` emits
`HoustonEvent::AuthRequired`. Desktop listens in `use-session-events.ts`, sets
`authRequired`, and `ProviderReconnectCard` renders inside chat via
`ChatPanel.afterMessages`. The card opens `claude auth login --claudeai` or
`codex login` through `/v1/providers/:name/login` and polls provider status
until the CLI reports authenticated.

**Headless connect uses two completion shapes.** A remote client (the webapp
or mobile PWA pointed at a hosted engine) can't receive the CLI's `localhost`
OAuth callback, so the connect surfaces that render `ProviderLoginDialog`
(`ProviderPicker`, `ProviderSettings`) pass `deviceAuth: !isTauri()`. That
flips codex to its device-code flow (`codex login --device-auth`): the engine
surfaces a verification URL plus a one-time `ProviderLoginUrl.user_code`, the
user enters that code on OpenAI's page, and codex polls + writes
`~/.codex/auth.json` itself (no paste-back). **codex colourizes stdout even
over a pipe**, so the relay strips ANSI escape sequences from each line before
scanning (`login_relay::strip_ansi`): the `\x1b[94m` wrapper's trailing `m`
otherwise sits flush against the code and defeats the `\b` anchor in the
device-code regex, leaving `user_code` unset and the dialog wrongly stuck on
paste-back. Claude has no device variant —
its standard login already completes headlessly via the paste-back code
(`/v1/providers/:name/login/code`), so the flag is a no-op for it. Note the
mid-chat `ProviderReconnectCard` / `auth-reconnect-banner` don't render the
dialog, so headless re-auth currently routes through the picker/settings; the
device-code requires the user's OpenAI account to have device sign-in enabled.

### Cancelling / retrying a stuck sign-in

A login subprocess only ends when the CLI exits, the user pastes a code, or
the 10-minute relay timeout fires (`LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT` in
`engine-core::provider::login_relay`). If the user closes the OAuth tab before
finishing, the CLI keeps its localhost callback open and just hangs — so the
status poll never flips to authenticated and the connect UI spins. Worse, a
fresh Connect click is rejected by `insert_session` as "already pending" until
the timeout, which read to users as "I have to restart the app" (#237).

`POST /v1/providers/:name/login/cancel` → `cancel_login` fixes this: it removes
the in-flight session from `LOGIN_SESSIONS` **eagerly** (so the next Connect
isn't rejected) and signals the relay task — which holds an `Arc<Notify>` clone
— to kill the subprocess. The relay emits a **benign**
`ProviderLoginComplete { success: false, error: null }`; the frontend treats a
completion with no `error` as "not an error" and silently clears its pending
spinner (no toast). A monotonic per-session token guards the relay's
end-of-life map cleanup so it can't evict a freshly-spawned retry session that
reused the same provider id. All three connect surfaces wire to it: the
onboarding brain mission's "Cancel and try again", the workspace-setup
`ProviderPicker`, and the settings `ProviderSettings` account rows.

Codex has one extra wrinkle: it can emit retry-shaped 401 messages while it
refreshes or reconnects, then continue successfully. Treat the synthetic
`__auth_retry__` marker as provisional. Suppress it, remember it, and emit
`AuthRequired` only if the session exits with an auth-flavored error. Terminal
401 / unauthenticated messages still emit `AuthRequired` immediately.

OpenAI provider status should prefer `codex login status` over shallow
`~/.codex/auth.json` parsing. Keep the auth-file check only as fallback for old
Codex versions or unrelated config-load failures, because config drift should
not look like sign-out.

Provider status uses tri-state auth: `authenticated`, `unauthenticated`, or
`unknown`. Reconnect UI renders from feed signals only when status confirms
`unauthenticated`; `unknown` resolves the signal without a card.

Claude Code can sometimes return `Error: Unknown error` for non-auth failures.
Treat that shape as a prompt to run `claude auth status`, not as logout by
itself. Emit `AuthRequired` only when the status probe confirms
`unauthenticated`.

Never mutate `~/.codex/config.toml` to make Codex read Houston agent
instructions. Agent directories already expose `CLAUDE.md` through an
`AGENTS.md` symlink, and global Codex config writes can land under the active
TOML table and break Codex startup.

## Gemini (API key, no CLI login)

Gemini does not have an OAuth-style `gemini auth login`. The CLI reads
credentials from one of three places, in order:

1. `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) environment variable in the
   spawning shell.
2. `~/.gemini/.env` file with the same env-var format.
3. `~/.gemini/settings.json` with a `selectedAuthType` and matching
   credential block.

`GeminiAdapter::probe_auth` (in `engine/houston-terminal-manager/src/provider/gemini.rs`)
checks all three. Any positive signal returns `authenticated`; missing
file or missing key returns `unauthenticated`; parse / I/O errors map to
`unknown` (NOT `authenticated`, per the no-silent-failures rule).

`probe_auth` runs synchronously off the file system, no spawn. It is
the same path used by `GET /v1/providers/gemini/status` and by the
session runner's pre-spawn auth gate.

### `launch_login("gemini")` returns BadRequest

Because there is no CLI login, the `ProviderAdapter::login_args` impl
returns `None`. `engine-core::provider::launch_login` surfaces this as
`BadRequest("gemini has no CLI login flow, connect via settings instead")`.
Same for logout. The desktop frontend short-circuits before this path
is reached: the provider picker checks `loginKind === "apiKey"` and
opens the Connect-API-Key dialog instead of calling
`/v1/providers/gemini/login`.

### Connect flow (Option A-lite, current)

The picker's Gemini card opens a modal with three steps:

1. Open `https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey` in the user's browser
   (`tauriSystem.openUrl`).
2. Show a Copy-able `export GEMINI_API_KEY=...` snippet.
3. Restart Houston so the env var is in scope for the engine
   subprocess.

Strings live under the `providers.apiKeyConnect.*` namespace
(`app/src/locales/{en,es,pt}/providers.json`). Component:
`app/src/components/shell/api-key-connect-dialog.tsx`. Provider config:
`app/src/lib/providers.ts` (`loginKind`, `apiKeyConsoleUrl`,
`apiKeyEnvVar` fields).

### Connect flow (Option A, in-flight)

The follow-up flow writes the key directly to `~/.gemini/.env` so the
user does not have to fiddle with shell rc files. The engine route is
`POST /v1/providers/gemini/credentials` (atomic write, mode 0600,
parent dir ensure). When the in-flight upgrade lands, the dialog gains
a paste input + Save button and the restart-Houston step disappears.

### HOME isolation for spawned gemini sessions

Gemini-cli loads `<HOME>/.gemini/GEMINI.md` as global memory on every
invocation, and its built-in memory tool auto-appends the user's
cross-project preferences to that file. Without isolation, every
Houston-spawned gemini inherits notes from the user's other projects
("Initializing Workspace... Ombra library", Alpine.js styling rules,
etc.) and answers Houston tasks with the wrong context.

`houston-terminal-manager::gemini_home::ensure_gemini_runtime_home`
builds a Houston-managed HOME at `~/.houston/runtime/gemini-home/`
containing only `.gemini/oauth_creds.json` + `google_accounts.json`
+ `.env` symlinked from the real home (so OAuth and API-key auth
both keep working without re-auth) plus a minimal
`.gemini/settings.json` that mirrors the user's `selectedType`. No
`GEMINI.md` is present, so global memory discovery finds nothing.
Per-agent context still flows because gemini-cli walks UP from
`cwd` and the agent dir contains `GEMINI.md → CLAUDE.md` seeded by
`seed_agent`. Both `gemini_runner::spawn_gemini` and
`sessions::summarize::run_gemini_summary` set `cmd.env("HOME", ...)`
to this runtime path before spawning.

**Windows symlink fallback.** Stock Windows installs reject
`symlink_file` (os error 1314, "A required privilege is not held by
the client") unless Developer Mode or admin is on. `ensure_symlink`
falls back to `fs::copy`. If the real-home source file does not
exist yet — common for first-time gemini users who have not
completed OAuth or pasted an API key — the Windows path treats the
missing source as "skip this entry" instead of erroring. Without
that, the user-visible toast was: _"Failed to prepare gemini
runtime home: The system cannot find the file specified. (os
error 2). Houston cannot spawn gemini safely without it."_
